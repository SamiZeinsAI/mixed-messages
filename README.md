# Random "Yo Mama" Joke Generator

This is a simple JavaScript program that generates a random "Yo Mama" joke each time it's run. The joke is then displayed on a webpage.

## How It Works

The program has three lists: one of adjectives, one of professions, and one of funny activities. It randomly selects one item from each list and inserts them into a "Yo Mama" joke template.

## Usage

To see a joke, simply open the HTML file in your web browser. Each time you refresh the page, a new joke will be generated.

## Code Example

Here's the main part of the code, which generates and displays the joke:
